A template utility program is provided in the directory "nummod".
To compile the program, go into that directory and type "make".
This will compile the program "nummod" from the c source code.
This code has a variety of functions that you may use to solve the homework problems.
The code as it is provided does not have any meaning; it is simply a collection of functions
to help you get started.

The program "nummod" requires additional files as input. The "atom parameter file"
is provided in the directory "prms". The receptor and ligand protein files
("rec.ms" and "lig.ms") are provided in the data directory.
You may want to copy these files to a location you find more convenient.

Thus, a sample run of the program could look like this:
./nummod -p atom.prm rec.ms lig.ms
